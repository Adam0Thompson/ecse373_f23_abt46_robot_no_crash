### Description:
robot_no_crash is a node that will prevent a robot generated by the package stdr_simulator from crashing into a maze. This package is dependent on stdr_simulator. 

## Launch files
There are two launch files that are contained in this package that were written for this package:
- robot_supervisor.launch
    - This launch file runs robot_no_crash under the specified namespace.
    - arguments:
        - robot_ns: This parameter can be null, or should be the namespace of the robot this package is being launched to control.
- 2D_Lidar_robot.launch
    - This launch file includes robot_supervisor.launch, as well as stdr_simulator_with_map_and_gui_and_robot.launch

Typically you will want to run 2D_Lidar_robot.launch, which can be done using the following
